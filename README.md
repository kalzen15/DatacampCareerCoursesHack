# DatacampCareerCoursesHack
This project will give you the way to complete the career tracks of datacamp efficiently and in a short time frame.

Please star the repo!!!

# Explained
The Courses folder holds the courses from the Datacamp Career Tracks. Since the tracks have a lot of overlapping courses which once completed in one track doesn't need to be done again in the other track.

So the Edited folder holds the courses that u need to do and the order_of_courses.txt holds the order in which u should do them
